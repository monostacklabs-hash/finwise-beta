# Credit Cards Explained (2025)

## What is a Credit Card?

A credit card is **borrowed money** from a bank. It's NOT your money - it's a loan that you need to pay back.

## Key Concepts (Simple Terms)

### 1. Credit Limit
**What it is:** The maximum amount you can borrow
**Example:** If your limit is $5,000, you can spend up to $5,000

### 2. Current Balance (What You Owe)
**What it is:** How much you've spent and haven't paid back yet
**Example:** You spent $1,200 this month → you owe $1,200

### 3. Available Credit
**What it is:** How much you can still spend
**Formula:** Credit Limit - Current Balance
**Example:** $5,000 limit - $1,200 spent = $3,800 available

### 4. Billing Cycle (Monthly)
**What it is:** Credit cards work on monthly cycles (usually 30 days)
**How it works:**
- Day 1-30: You spend money
- Day 30: Statement generated (shows what you owe)
- Day 51: Payment due (21 days later)

### 5. Statement Balance
**What it is:** The total you owed at the end of last month
**Important:** This is what you should pay to avoid interest

### 6. Minimum Payment
**What it is:** The smallest amount you MUST pay to avoid late fees
**Warning:** Only paying minimum = you pay interest on the rest
**Typical:** 2-3% of balance or $25 (whichever is higher)

### 7. Payment Due Date
**What it is:** Deadline to pay (usually 21-25 days after statement)
**Miss it:** Late fee ($25-$40) + hurts credit score

### 8. APR (Annual Percentage Rate)
**What it is:** Interest rate if you don't pay full balance
**Typical in 2025:** 18-25% per year
**Example:** Owe $1,000 at 20% APR = ~$200 interest per year

### 9. Grace Period
**What it is:** Time before interest starts (usually 21 days)
**How to avoid interest:** Pay full statement balance before due date

### 10. Credit Utilization
**What it is:** Percentage of credit limit you're using
**Formula:** (Balance / Credit Limit) × 100
**Example:** $1,200 balance / $5,000 limit = 24% utilization
**Best practice:** Keep under 30% for good credit score
